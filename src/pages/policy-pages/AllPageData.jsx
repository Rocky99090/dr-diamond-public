    <p><b>Dr Diamond</b> is an online gaming and betting platform where you can place bets on games and sports. We are committed to promoting responsible betting practices to provide all our users with a safe and enjoyable betting environment. Please carefully read the following guidelines.</p>

    <h2>1. Always Set Betting Limits</h2>
